> Consider the **searching problem**:
>
> **Input**: A sequence of $ n $ numbers $ A = \langle a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n \rangle $
> and a value $\nu$.
>
> **Output**: And index $i$ such that $ \nu = A[i] $ or the special value $NIL$ if $\nu$ does
> not appear in $A$
>
> Write the pseudocode for *linear search*, which scans through the sequence, looking

> At the start of each iteration of the for loop, the subarray $A[1..i - 1]$ consists
