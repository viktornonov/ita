## The Role of Alfgorithms in Computing
* Algorithm is any well defined computational procedure that takes some value or set of values, as input and produces some value or set of values as ouput
  * Algorithm describes a specific computational procedure for acheaving input/output relationship
  - permutation = reordering
* given input of algorithm is called **instance** of the problem
* an algorithm is **correct** if, for every input instance, it produces the correct output
  - incorrect algorithms also can be useful, if we can control their error rate (finding large prime numbers)
* Applications of algorithms
  - Human Genome Project
  - Internet - finding good routes on which the data will travel, search engines - graph algorithms
  - Cryptography, digital signatures - number theory and numerical algorithms
  - shortest route - graph algorithms
  - library of mechanical parts where each part can may include instances of other parts and we need to list the parts in order - topological sorting
  - finding convex hull of n points (convex hull is the smallest convex polygon containing the points)
* Data structues is a way to store and organize data in order to facilitate access and modifications
* NP-complete - problem for which no efficitient solution is known (traveling-salesman problem)
